## Simple Maze Solver
Created a simple maze solver in Java. Two file versions exist.
Solver.java and SolverExtended.java - Solver.java is the basic design, while SolverExtended.java aims to use the algorithm developed by Tsinghua University Scientists that performs better than Dijkstra's algorithm (Read: https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1mseli4/dijkstra_got_defeated_after_40_years_by_tsinghua/)
